      <!--
        When creating this part of the site, I could not figure out how to keep the menu icon in the foreground while also ensuring that the nav bar actually displayed right underneath the header-banner-thing. Eventually I found a solution here:
         https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15782078/bring-element-to-front-using-css

         Initially, I tried to create another checkbox which would close the menu, but using only CSS this seemed impossible. There was already a rule applied which made the nav-bar display as "block", so another checkbox applying rules to the nav bar did not work. Even if it had worked, it probably would have meant that I would be unable to get the nav bar back again without refreshing the page and then checking the 1st box again. 

         I could probably get the x-button working with JS, but that's not the corriculum and I'll stay away from it for now. Also, I eventually realized I could have just used "position" and "top" to put it inside of my h1 heading. This way it is on top (read, foreground, clickable) the entire time, it looks way nicer and I wouldn't need to bother with all this research. But I'm glad I did it, let's call  it a learning moment.

        <h1 class="article_header">This is My Page</h1>

        <p class="article_txt">
          I have made this site to practice creating layouts with HTML and CSS.
          My goal is not to create something that is nessecarily beautiful, but
          rather to create a responsive site that functions on both mobile and
          desktop/tablets. I also aim to create semantic and meaningful HTML.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          Copywriting and colors are not my priority here, my only goal is to
          get practice in creating a functioning and flexing site.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article_header">My Progress Thus Far</h2>

        <h3 class="article_header">The Blog</h3>
        <p class="article_txt">
          This part of the blog text was written a little late in the process of
          creating the site. I only realized how important using this part of
          the site as a personal development blog after creating
          <a href="product.html">the product site</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          The first thing I did to create my site was make the index.html site
          (this one). I started simple with a blog style site, that had a nav
          bar and a footer, with the main content in the middle.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          I have added this to demonstrate that the footer position is not
          determined by an absolute value, rather is is determined by the size
          of article.article_box. This is done using calc on &lt;article
          class="article_box"&gt;:
        </p>
        <p class="code_example">min-height: calc(100vh - 700px);</p>
        <p class="article_txt">
          The idea to use calc to ensure that the footer is properly placed on
          the bottom was taken from stackowerflow, but sadly I can't find the
          correct article any more. I'll take this as a learning experience and
          remember to make notes consecutively.

        <section class="nice_img" title="nice image, flowers">
          <span></span>
        </section>

        <!--The empty <span> was added, as there needs to be some "content" to the section if it is to display anything. Even if there is a background image set in CSS. There's probably a workaround, so I should revisit this later -->

        <h3 class="article_header">The Webshop</h3>
        <p class="article_txt">
          Going into this project, I knew that creating a "webshop" was going to
          be both a challenge and important to my career. There's many different
          types of sites out there, but making a webshop seems highly relevant
          for potential future employers.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          To begin with, I simply copied the header and footer from my existing
          site (the blog) and inserted that into the webshop document. I also
          had a functioning CSS stylesheet from before, so I used that as the
          base for my webshops CSS. For the rules that were only going to be
          applied to my webshop, I created a new stylesheet and linked it as the
          2nd CSS stylesheet on my HTML document. This way I wouldn't run into
          specificity issues and could run both rulesets.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          The thing to do after I made the basic setup and linking of the
          stylesheets was to add the elements I wanted on my page. One of the
          things that made (and still makes) my process hard is the fact that I
          did not start by making a layout in Adobe XD or even sketching out my
          structure. Knowing what elements I want to add and where they should
          go isn't easy without a plan, so I've let my mind wander while
          thinking of what layouts other sites go for. I'll make this another
          learning moment.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          13.01.22, I made some more content for the webshop.html page today. It
          was pretty empty before, there was only the hero image and the
          scrollable featured products yet. I added the categories today and
          styled them. I decided to go by a max of four to keep it simple. The
          goal isn't perfection, but practice and I am happy with how they
          turned out. The contrast on the shoes-category isn't the best, but I
          tried to improve this by darkening the background of the a element.
          It's not perfect, but it works.
