        <h2 class="article_header">This is My Page</h2>

        <p class="article_txt">
          I have made this site to practice creating layouts with HTML and CSS.
          My goal is not to create something that is nessecarily beautiful, but
          rather to create a responsive site that functions on both mobile and
          desktop/tablets. I also aim to create semantic and meaningful HTML.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          Copywriting and colors are not my priority here, my only goal is to
          get practice in creating a functioning and flexing site.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article_header">My Progress Thus Far</h2>

        <h3 class="article_header">The Blog</h3>
        <p class="article_txt">
          This part of the blog text was written a little late in the process of
          creating the site. I only realized how important using this part of
          the site as a personal development blog after creating
          <a href="product.html">the product site</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          The first thing I did to create my site was make the index.html site
          (this one). I started simple with a blog style site, that had a nav
          bar and a footer, with the main content in the middle.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          I have added this to demonstrate that the footer position is not
          determined by an absolute value, rather is is determined by the size
          of article.article_box. This is done using calc on &lt;main&gt;:
        </p>
        <p class="code_example">min-height: calc(100vh - 700px);</p>
        <p class="article_txt">
          The idea to use calc to ensure that the footer is properly placed on
          the bottom was taken from stackowerflow, but sadly I can't find the
          correct article any more. I'll take this as a learning experience and
          remember to make notes consecutively.
        </p>

        <!--HERE IS WHERE I WANT A BACKGROUND IMAGE WITH THE PARALLAX EFFECT-->

        <section class="nice_img" title="nice image, flowers">
          <span></span>
        </section>

        <!--The empty <span> was added, as there needs to be some "content" to the section if it is to display anything. Even if there is a background image set in CSS. There's probably a workaround, so I should revisit this later -->

        <h3 class="article_header">The Webshop</h3>
        <p class="article_txt">
          Going into this project, I knew that creating a "webshop" was going to
          be both a challenge and important to my career. There's many different
          types of sites out there, but making a webshop seems highly relevant
          for potential future employers.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          To begin with, I simply copied the header and footer from my existing
          site (the blog) and inserted that into the webshop document. I also
          had a functioning CSS stylesheet from before, so I used that as the
          base for my webshops CSS. For the rules that were only going to be
          applied to my webshop, I created a new stylesheet and linked it as the
          2nd CSS stylesheet on my HTML document. This way I wouldn't run into
          specificity issues and could run both rulesets.
        </p>

        <p class="article_txt">
          The thing to do after I made the basic setup and linking of the
          stylesheets was to add the elements I wanted on my page. One of the
          things that made (and still makes) my process hard is the fact that I
          did not start by making a layout in Adobe XD or even sketching out my
          structure. Knowing what elements I want to add and where they should
          go isn't easy without a plan, so I've let my mind wander while
          thinking of what layouts other sites go for. I'll make this another
          learning moment.
